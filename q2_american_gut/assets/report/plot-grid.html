'COMP_CHART_TEXT_MODAL': 'This interactive graph allows you to explore the difference between the bacteria found in your sample and the bacteria found in the samples of specific groups. For example, you can compare your sample against others in your age group or those who share your type of diet. Hover your mouse over the bars, and the graph will show the direction of change for the taxa that are different between your sample and the comparison group you choose. For example, if you choose Class as the taxa level and age-20s as the category for comparison, you will see several bars pointing up (representing an increase in that taxa in your sample compared to the comparison group) and down (representing a decrease in that taxa in your sample compared to the comparison group), and each bar will be labelled by bacterial Class. Hovering your mouse over the blue bars will show you how much more or less of that taxa you have than the average participant in the category selected. By default, we compare you with all samples of the same type, e.g. all stool if your sample is stool.<br/><br/> <strong>Summary of Interactive Chart Function:</strong> <br/><br/>- Select Sample: Choose the sample that you want to compare to the average participant sample.<br/><br/>- Select Taxa Level: (Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus) -Determines the taxanomic level at which you will compare your sample.<br/><br/>- Select Category : Determines the group of participants to which you will compare your sample.<br/><br/>- Hover Mouse Over Bar: Displays the taxa and amount of change between your sample and the comparison.',

Alpha diversity is the amount of diversity found within a sample.
This graph compares the alpha diversity in your sample with the alpha diversity in all samples.
On the graph, the vertical black line represents your sample\'s alpha diversity.
The blue curve shows the distribution of diversity across all samples.
The peak of the blue curve shows the average sample\'s alpha diversity.
This will allow you to see how the alpha diversity of your sample compares to that of the average sample.
<br/>This graph illustrates Faith\'s Phylogenetic Diversity (PD), which calculates the level of phylogenetic diversity in your sample.
The X-axis shows PD diversity, increasing left to right.
This measure of alpha diversity uses a phylogenetic tree to determine the diversity or richness of your sample.
For more information on alpha diversity, please see our two part blog post:

<div name='taxa-plot'>
{{taxa}}
You can explore the relative abundances of bacterial taxa found in your sample(s).
The taxonomic levels that you can look at range from Phylum (shallow) to Genus (deep).
An explanation of taxonomy and taxonomic levels can be read <a href="https://microbio.me/%(sitebase)sauthed/addendum/#taxcharts">here</a>;
for an explanation of why 16S marker gene sequencing cannot identify species, please see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1950982/">this paper</a>). If you look at deeper taxonomic levels, they will be colored different shades of the corresponding phylum color. Rolling over a color will tell you the bacterial taxonomy and relative abundance of that taxonomy in that sample.
<br/>- Select taxa level: (Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus) - will determine the level shown on each of the samples in the graph.
