<strong>These are your microbes!</strong>
Here you can explore both the types and amounts of bacteria we\'ve found in your sample.
Dive deeper into your results and see how your microbes compare to other participants

<div name='alpha-diversity-plot'>
{{ alpha }}
Alpha diversity is the amount of diversity found within a sample.
This graph compares the alpha diversity in your sample with the alpha diversity in all samples.
On the graph, the vertical black line represents your sample\'s alpha diversity.
The blue curve shows the distribution of diversity across all samples.
The peak of the blue curve shows the average sample\'s alpha diversity.
This will allow you to see how the alpha diversity of your sample compares to that of the average sample.
<br/>This graph illustrates Faith\'s Phylogenetic Diversity (PD), which calculates the level of phylogenetic diversity in your sample.
The X-axis shows PD diversity, increasing left to right.
This measure of alpha diversity uses a phylogenetic tree to determine the diversity or richness of your sample.
For more information on alpha diversity, please see our two part blog post:

<div name='taxa-plot'>
{{ taxa }}
You can explore the relative abundances of bacterial taxa found in your sample(s).
The taxonomic levels that you can look at range from Phylum (shallow) to Genus (deep).
An explanation of taxonomy and taxonomic levels can be read <a href="https://microbio.me/%(sitebase)sauthed/addendum/#taxcharts">here</a>;
for an explanation of why 16S marker gene sequencing cannot identify species, please see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1950982/">this paper</a>). If you look at deeper taxonomic levels, they will be colored different shades of the corresponding phylum color. Rolling over a color will tell you the bacterial taxonomy and relative abundance of that taxonomy in that sample.
<br/>- Select taxa level: (Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus) - will determine the level shown on each of the samples in the graph.
